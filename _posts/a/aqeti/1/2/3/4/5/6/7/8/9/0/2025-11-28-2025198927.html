<h2 id="live-tracking">Live User Tracking</h2>

<p>WebSocket implementation enables bidirectional communication between user browsers and analytics systems, supporting real-time data collection and immediate content adaptation. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, WebSocket connections maintain persistent communication channels that transmit data instantly as user interactions occur.</p>

<p>Server-sent events provide alternative real-time communication for scenarios where data primarily flows from server to client. Content performance updates, trending topic notifications, and personalization adjustments can all leverage server-sent events for efficient real-time delivery.</p>

<p>Edge computing tracking processes user interactions at Cloudflare's global network edge rather than waiting for data to reach central analytics systems. This distributed approach reduces latency and enables immediate responses to user behavior without the delay of round-trip communications to distant data centers.</p>

<h3>Event Streaming</h3>

<p>Clickstream analysis captures sequences of user interactions in real-time, revealing immediate intent signals and engagement patterns. Real-time clickstream processing identifies emerging trends, content preferences, and conversion paths as they develop rather than after they complete.</p>

<p>Attention monitoring tracks how users engage with content moment-by-moment, providing immediate feedback about content effectiveness. Scroll depth, mouse movements, and focus duration all serve as real-time indicators of content relevance and engagement quality.</p>

<p>Conversion funnel monitoring observes user progress through defined conversion paths in real-time, identifying drop-off points as they occur. Immediate funnel analysis enables prompt intervention through content adjustments or personalized assistance when users hesitate or disengage.</p>

<h2 id="stream-processing">Stream Processing Architecture</h2>
