description: "A practical troubleshooting guide using Cloudflare metrics to diagnose and solve the most common speed and performance problems on GitHub Pages sites."
---
<p>Your GitHub Pages site feels slower than it should be. Pages take a few seconds to load, images seem sluggish, and you are worried it's hurting your user experience and SEO rankings. You know performance matters, but you are not sure where the bottlenecks are or how to fix them on a static site. This sluggishness can cause visitors to leave before they even see your content, wasting your hard work.</p>

<h2 id="why-github-pages-can-be-slow">Why a Static GitHub Pages Site Can Still Be Slow</h2>
<p>It is a common misconception: "It's static HTML, so it must be lightning fast." While the server-side processing is minimal, the end-user experience depends on many other factors. The sheer size of the files being downloaded (especially unoptimized images, fonts, and JavaScript) is the number one culprit. A giant 3MB hero image can bring a page to its knees on a mobile connection.</p>
<p>Other issues include render-blocking resources where CSS or JavaScript files must load before the page can be displayed, too many external HTTP requests (for fonts, analytics, third-party widgets), and lack of browser caching. Also, while GitHub's servers are good, they may not be geographically optimal for all visitors. A user in Asia accessing a server in the US will have higher latency. Cloudflare helps you see and solve each of these issues.</p>

<h2 id="using-cloudflare-to-diagnose">Using Cloudflare Data as Your Performance Diagnostic Tool</h2>
<p>Cloudflare provides several ways to diagnose slowness. First, the standard Analytics dashboard shows aggregate performance metrics from real visitors. Look for trends—does performance dip at certain times or for certain pages? More powerful is the **Cloudflare Speed tab**. Here, you can run a Lighthouse audit directly on any of your pages with a single click.</p>
<p>Lighthouse is an open-source tool from Google that audits performance, accessibility, SEO, and more. When run through Cloudflare, it gives you a detailed report with scores and, most importantly, specific, actionable recommendations. It will tell you exactly which images are too large, which resources are render-blocking, and what your Core Web Vitals scores are. This report is your starting point for all fixes.</p>

<h3 id="key-lighthouse-metrics">Key Lighthouse Performance Metrics To Target</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):</strong> Should be less than 2.5 seconds. Marks when the main content appears.</li>
<li><strong>First Input Delay (FID):</strong> Should be less than 100 ms. Measures interactivity responsiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):</strong> Should be less than 0.1. Measures visual stability.</li>
<li><strong>Total Blocking Time (TBT):</strong> Should be low. Measures main thread busyness.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="identifying-image-bottlenecks">Identifying and Fixing Image Related Bottlenecks</h2>
<p>Images are almost always the largest files on a page. The Lighthouse report will list "Opportunities" like "Serve images in next-gen formats" (WebP/AVIF) and "Properly size images." Your first action should be a comprehensive image audit. For every image on your site, especially in posts with screenshots or diagrams, ensure it is:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compressed:</strong> Use tools like Squoosh.app, ImageOptim, or the `sharp` library in a build script to reduce file size without noticeable quality loss.</li>
<li><strong>In Modern Format:</strong> Convert PNG/JPG to WebP. Tools like Cloudflare Polish can do this automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Correctly Sized:</strong> Do not use a 2000px wide image if it will only be displayed at 400px. Resize it to the exact display dimensions.</li>
<li><strong>Lazy Loaded:</strong> Use the `loading="lazy"` attribute on `img` tags so images below the viewport load only when needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>For Jekyll users, consider using an image processing plugin like `jekyll-picture-tag` or `jekyll-responsive-image` to automate this during site generation. The performance gain from fixing images alone can be massive.</p>

<h2 id="optimizing-delivery-network">Optimizing Delivery with Cloudflare CDN and Caching</h2>
<p>This is where Cloudflare shines beyond just analytics. If you have connected your domain to Cloudflare (even just for analytics), you can enable its CDN and caching features. Go to the "Caching" section in your Cloudflare dashboard. Enable "Always Online" to serve a cached copy if GitHub is down.</p>
<p>Most impactful is configuring "Browser Cache TTL". Set this to at least "1 month" for static assets. This tells visitors' browsers to store your CSS, JS, and images locally, so they don't need to be re-downloaded on subsequent visits. Also, enable "Auto Minify" for HTML, CSS, and JS to remove unnecessary whitespace and comments. For image-heavy sites, turn on "Polish" (automatic WebP conversion) and "Mirage" (mobile-optimized image loading).</p>

<h2 id="theme-and-script-blunders">Addressing Theme and JavaScript Blunders</h2>
<p>Many free Jekyll themes come with performance baggage: dozens of font-awesome icons, large JavaScript libraries for minor features, or unoptimized CSS. Use your browser's Developer Tools (Network tab) to see every file loaded. Identify large `.js` or `.css` files from your theme that you don't actually use.</p>
<p>Simplify. Do you need a full jQuery library for a simple toggle? Probably not. Consider replacing heavy JavaScript features with pure CSS solutions. Defer non-critical JavaScript using the `defer` attribute. For fonts, consider using system fonts (`font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI"`) to eliminate external font requests entirely, which can shave off a surprising amount of load time.</p>

<pre><code>
<!-- Example of deferring non-critical theme scripts -->
<!-- In your _includes/head.html or layout file -->
<script src="{{ "/assets/js/main.js" | relative_url }}" defer></script>

<!-- Consider removing or replacing jQuery if possible -->
<!-- Instead of: <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script> -->
<!-- See if your theme's functionality can work with vanilla JS -->
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ongoing-monitoring-plan">Building an Ongoing Performance Monitoring Plan</h2>
<p>Performance is not a one-time fix. Every new post with images, every theme update, or new script added can regress your scores. Create a simple monitoring routine. Once a month, run a Cloudflare Lighthouse audit on your homepage and your top 3 most visited posts. Note the scores and check if they have dropped.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on your Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console if connected, as this directly impacts SEO. Use Cloudflare Analytics to monitor real-user performance trends. By making performance review a regular habit, you catch issues early and maintain a fast, professional, and search-friendly website that keeps visitors engaged.</p>
<p>Do not tolerate a slow site. Right now, open your Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Speed tab, and run a Lighthouse test on your homepage. Address the very first "Opportunity" or "Diagnostic" item on the list. This single action will make a measurable difference for every single visitor to your site from this moment on.</p>
