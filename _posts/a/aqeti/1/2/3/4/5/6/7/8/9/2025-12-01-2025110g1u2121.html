description: "Learn how to leverage Cloudflare security features like DDoS protection WAF and Bot Management to secure your static GitHub Pages site"
---

While GitHub Pages provides a secure and maintained hosting environment, the moment you point a custom domain to it, your site becomes exposed to the broader internet's background noise of malicious traffic. Static sites are not immune to threats they can be targets for DDoS attacks, content scraping, and vulnerability scanning that consume your resources and obscure your analytics. Cloudflare acts as a protective shield in front of your GitHub Pages site, filtering out bad traffic before it even reaches the origin. This guide will walk you through the essential security features within Cloudflare, from automated DDoS mitigation to configurable Web Application Firewall rules, ensuring your static site remains fast, available, and secure.

<h2 id="securityoverview">The Cloudflare Security Model for Static Sites</h2>

<p>It is a common misconception that static sites are completely immune to security concerns. While they are certainly more secure than dynamic sites with databases and user input, they still face significant risks. The primary threats to a static site are availability attacks, resource drain, and reputation damage. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, for instance, aims to overwhelm your site with so much traffic that it becomes unavailable to legitimate users.</p>

<p>Cloudflare addresses these threats by sitting between your visitors and your GitHub Pages origin. Every request to your site first passes through Cloudflare's global network. This strategic position allows Cloudflare to analyze each request based on a massive corpus of threat intelligence and custom rules you define. Malicious requests are blocked at the edge, while clean traffic is passed through seamlessly. This model not only protects your site but also reduces unnecessary load on GitHub's servers, and by extension, your own build limits, ensuring your site remains online and responsive even during an attack.</p>

<h2 id="ddosprotection">Configuring DDoS Protection and Security Levels</h2>

<p>Cloudflare's DDoS protection is automatically enabled and actively mitigates attacks for all domains on its network. This system uses adaptive algorithms to identify attack patterns in real-time without any manual intervention required from you. However, you can fine-tune its sensitivity to match your traffic patterns.</p>

<p>The first line of configurable defense is the Security Level, found under the Security app in your Cloudflare dashboard. This setting determines the challenge page threshold for visitors based on their IP reputation score. The settings range from "Essentially Off" to "I'm Under Attack!". For most sites, a setting of "Medium" is a good balance. This will challenge visitors with a CAPTCHA if their IP has a sufficiently poor reputation score. If you are experiencing a targeted attack, you can temporarily switch to "I'm Under Attack!". This mode presents an interstitial page that performs a browser integrity check before allowing access, effectively blocking simple botnets and scripted attacks. It is a powerful tool to have in your arsenal during a traffic surge of a suspicious nature.</p>

<h3 id="ratelimiting">Advanced Defense with Rate Limiting</h3>

<p>For more granular control, consider Cloudflare's Rate Limiting feature. This allows you to define rules that block IP addresses making an excessive number of requests in a short time. For example, you could create a rule that blocks an IP for 10 minutes if it makes more than 100 requests to your site within a 10-second window. This is highly effective against targeted brute-force scraping or low-volume application layer DDoS attacks. While this is a paid feature, it provides a precise tool for site owners who need to protect specific assets or API endpoints from abuse.</p>

<h2 id="wafrules">Implementing Web Application Firewall WAF Rules</h2>

<p>The Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a powerful tool that inspects incoming HTTP requests for known attack patterns and suspicious behavior. Even for a static site, the WAF can block common exploits and vulnerability scans that clutter your logs and pose a general threat.</p>

<p>Within the WAF section, you will find the Managed Rulesets. The Cloudflare Managed Ruleset is pre-configured and updated by Cloudflare's security team to protect against a wide range of threats, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. You should ensure this ruleset is enabled and set to the "Default" action, which is usually "Block". For a static site, this ruleset will rarely block legitimate traffic, but it will effectively stop automated scanners from probing your site for non-existent vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>You can also create custom WAF rules to address specific concerns. For instance, if you notice a particular path or file being aggressively scanned, you can create a rule to block all requests that contain that path in the URI. Another useful custom rule is to block requests from specific geographic regions if you have no audience there and see a high volume of attacks originating from those locations. This layered approach—using both managed and custom rules—creates a robust defense tailored to your site's unique profile.</p>

<h2 id="botmanagement">Controlling Automated Traffic with Bot Management</h2>

<p>Not all bots are malicious, but uncontrolled bot traffic can skew your analytics, consume your bandwidth, and slow down your site for real users. Cloudflare's Bot Management system identifies and classifies automated traffic, allowing you to decide how to handle it.</p>

<p>The system uses machine learning and behavioral analysis to detect bots, ranging from simple scrapers to advanced, headless browsers. In the Bot Fight Mode, found under the Security app, you can enable a simple, free mode that challenges known bots with a CAPTCHA. This is highly effective against low-sophistication bots and automated scripts. For more advanced protection, the full Bot Management product (available on enterprise plans) provides detailed scores and allows for granular actions like logging, allowing, or blocking based on the bot's likelihood score.</p>

<p>For a blog, managing bot traffic is crucial for maintaining the integrity of your analytics. By mitigating content-scraping bots and automated vulnerability scanners, you ensure that the data you see in your Cloudflare Analytics or other tools more accurately reflects human visitor behavior, which in turn leads to smarter content decisions.</p>

<h2 id="accesscontrol">Restricting Access with Cloudflare Access</h2>

<p>What if you have a part of your site that you do not want to be public? Perhaps you have a staging site, draft articles, or internal documentation built with GitHub Pages. Cloudflare Access allows you to build fine-grained, zero-trust controls around any subdomain or path on your site, all without needing a server.</p>

<p>Cloudflare Access works by placing an authentication gateway in front of any application you wish to protect. You can create a policy that defines who is allowed to reach a specific resource. For example, you could protect your entire `staging.yourdomain.com` subdomain. You then create a rule that only allows access to users with an email address from your company's domain or to specific named individuals. When an unauthenticated user tries to visit the protected URL, they are presented with a login page. Once they authenticate using a provider like Google, GitHub, or a one-time PIN, Cloudflare validates their identity against your policy and grants them access if they are permitted.</p>

<p>This is a revolutionary feature for static sites. It enables you to create private, authenticated areas on a platform designed for public content, greatly expanding the use cases for GitHub Pages for teams and professional workflows.</p>

<h2 id="monitoringthreats">Monitoring and Analyzing Security Threats</h2>

<p>A security system is only as good as your ability to understand its operations. Cloudflare provides comprehensive logging and analytics that give you deep insight into the threats being blocked and the overall security posture of your site.</p>

<p>The Security Insights dashboard on the Cloudflare homepage for your domain provides a high-level overview of the top mitigated threats, allowed requests, and top flagged countries. For a more detailed view, navigate to the Security Analytics section. Here, you can see a real-time log of all requests, color-coded by action (Blocked, Challenged, etc.). You can filter this view by action type, country, IP address, and rule ID. This is invaluable for investigating a specific incident or for understanding the nature of the background traffic hitting your site.</p>

<p>Regularly reviewing these reports helps you tune your security settings. If you see a particular country consistently appearing in the top blocked list and you have no audience there, you might create a WAF rule to block it outright. If you notice that a specific managed rule is causing false positives, you can choose to disable that individual rule while keeping the rest of the ruleset active. This proactive approach to security monitoring ensures your configurations remain effective and do not inadvertently block legitimate visitors.</p>

<p>By leveraging these Cloudflare security features, you transform your GitHub Pages site from a simple static host into a fortified web property. You protect its availability, ensure the integrity of your data, and create a trusted experience for your readers. A secure site is a reliable site, and reliability is the foundation of a professional online presence.</p>


<p><strong>Security is not just about blocking threats it is also about creating a seamless user experience.</strong> The next piece of the puzzle is using Cloudflare Page Rules to manage redirects, caching, and other edge behaviors that make your site smarter and more user-friendly.</p>
