<h2 id="how-caching-improves-speed">How caching improves speed</h2>
<p>Caching stores a copy of your content closer to your visitors so the browser does not need to fetch everything repeatedly from the origin server. When your site uses caching effectively, pages load faster, images appear instantly, and users experience almost no delay when navigating between pages.</p>

<p>Because GitHub Pages is static and rarely changes during normal use, caching becomes even more powerful. Most of your website files including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images are perfect candidates for long-term caching. This reduces loading time significantly and creates a smoother browsing experience.</p>

<p>Good caching does not only help visitors. It also reduces bandwidth usage at the origin, protects your site during traffic spikes, and allows your content to be delivered reliably to a global audience.</p>

<h2 id="why-github-pages-benefits-from-cloudflare">Why GitHub Pages benefits from Cloudflare</h2>
<p>GitHub Pages has limited caching control. While GitHub provides basic caching headers, you cannot modify them deeply without Cloudflare. The moment you add Cloudflare, you gain full control over how long assets stay cached, which pages are cached, and how aggressively Cloudflare should cache your site.</p>

<p>Cloudflare’s distributed network means your content is stored in multiple data centers worldwide. Visitors in Asia, Europe, or South America receive your site from servers near them instead of the United States origin. This drastically decreases latency.</p>

<p>With Cloudflare cache rules, you can also avoid performance issues caused by large assets or repeated visits from search engine crawlers. Assets are served directly from Cloudflare’s edge, making your GitHub Pages site ready for global traffic.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-cloudflare-cache-rules">Understanding Cloudflare cache rules</h2>
<p>Cloudflare cache rules allow you to specify how Cloudflare should handle each request. These rules give you the ability to decide whether a file should be cached, for how long, and under which conditions.</p>

<h3>Cache everything</h3>
<p>This option caches HTML pages, images, scripts, and even dynamic content. Since GitHub Pages is static, caching everything is safe and highly effective. It removes unnecessary trips to the origin and speeds up delivery.</p>

<h3>Bypass cache</h3>
<p>Certain files or directories may need to avoid caching. For example, temporary assets, preview pages, or admin-only tools should bypass caching so visitors always receive the latest version.</p>

<h3>Custom caching duration</h3>
<p>You can define how long Cloudflare stores content. Static websites often benefit from long durations such as 30 days or even 1 year for assets like images or fonts. Shorter durations work better for HTML content that may change more often.</p>

<h3>Edge TTL and Browser TTL</h3>
<p>Edge TTL determines how long Cloudflare keeps content in its servers. Browser TTL tells the visitor’s browser how long it should avoid refetching the file. Balancing these settings gives your site predictable performance.</p>

<h3>Standard cache vs. Ignore cache</h3>
<p>Standard cache respects any caching headers provided by GitHub Pages. Ignore cache overrides them and forces Cloudflare to cache based on your rules. This is useful when GitHub’s default headers do not match your needs.</p>

<h2 id="common-caching-scenarios-for-static-sites">Common caching scenarios for static sites</h2>
<p>Static websites typically rely on predictable patterns. Cloudflare makes it easy to configure your caching strategy based on common situations. These examples help you understand where caching brings the most benefit.</p>

<h3>Long term asset caching</h3>
<p>Images, CSS, and JavaScript rarely change once published. Assigning long caching durations ensures these files load instantly for returning visitors.</p>

<h3>Caching HTML safely</h3>
<p>Since GitHub Pages does not use server-side rendering, caching HTML is safe. This means your homepage and blog posts load extremely fast without hitting the origin server repeatedly.</p>

<h3>Reducing repeated crawler traffic</h3>
<p>Search engines frequently revisit your pages. Cached responses reduce load on the origin and ensure crawler traffic does not slow down your site.</p>

<h3>Speeding up international traffic</h3>
<p>Visitors far from GitHub’s origin benefit the most from Cloudflare edge caching. Your site loads consistently fast regardless of geographic distance.</p>

<h3>Handling large image galleries</h3>
<p>If your site contains many large images, caching prevents slow loading and reduces bandwidth consumption.</p>

<h2 id="step-by-step-how-to-configure-cache-rules">Step by step how to configure cache rules</h2>
<p>Configuring cache rules inside Cloudflare is beginner friendly. Once your domain is connected, you can follow these steps to create efficient caching behavior with minimal effort.</p>

<h3>Open the Rules panel</h3>
<p>Log in to Cloudflare, select your domain, and open the Rules tab. Choose Cache Rules to begin creating your caching strategy.</p>

<h3>Create a new rule</h3>
<p>Click Add Rule and give it a descriptive name like Cache HTML Pages or Static Asset Optimization. Names make management easier later.</p>

<h3>Define the matching expression</h3>
<p>Use URL patterns to match specific files or folders. For example, <code>/assets/*</code> matches all images, CSS, and script files in the assets directory.</p>

<h3>Select the caching action</h3>
<p>You can choose Cache Everything, Bypass Cache, or set custom caching values. Select the option that suits your content scenario.</p>

<h3>Adjust TTL values</h3>
<p>Set Edge TTL and Browser TTL according to how often that part of your site changes. Long TTLs provide better performance for static assets.</p>

<h3>Save and test the rule</h3>
<p>Open your site in a new browser session. Use developer tools or Cloudflare’s analytics to confirm whether the rule behaves as expected.</p>

<h2 id="caching-patterns-you-can-adopt">Caching patterns you can adopt</h2>
<p>The following patterns are practical examples you can apply immediately. They cover common needs of GitHub Pages users and are proven to improve performance.</p>

<h3>Cache everything for 30 minutes</h3>
<pre><code>HTML, images, CSS, JS → cached for 30 minutes</code></pre>

<h3>Long term caching for assets</h3>
<pre><code>/assets/* → cache for 1 year</code></pre>

<h3>Bypass caching for preview folders</h3>
<pre><code>/drafts/* → no caching applied</code></pre>

<h3>Short cache for homepage</h3>
<pre><code>/index.html → cache for 10 minutes</code></pre>

<h3>Force caching even with weak headers</h3>
<pre><code>Ignore cache → Cloudflare handles everything</code></pre>

<h2 id="how-to-handle-cache-invalidation">How to handle cache invalidation</h2>
<p>Cache invalidation ensures visitors always receive the correct version of your site when you update content. Cloudflare offers multiple methods for clearing outdated cached content.</p>

<h3>Using Cache Purge</h3>
<p>You can purge everything in one click or target a specific URL. Purging everything is useful after a major update, while purging a single file is better when only one asset has changed.</p>

<h3>Versioned file naming</h3>
<p>Another strategy is to use version numbers in asset names like <code>style-v2.css</code>. Each new version becomes a new file, avoiding conflicts with older cached copies.</p>

<h3>Short TTL for dynamic pages</h3>
<p>Pages that change more often should use shorter TTL values so visitors do not see outdated content. Even on static sites, certain pages like announcements may require frequent updates.</p>

<h2 id="mistakes-to-avoid-when-using-cache">Mistakes to avoid when using cache</h2>
<p>Caching is powerful but can create confusion when misconfigured. Beginners often make predictable mistakes that are easy to avoid with proper understanding.</p>

<h3>Overusing long TTL on HTML</h3>
<p>HTML content may need updates more frequently than assets. Assigning overly long TTLs can cause outdated content to appear to visitors.</p>

<h3>Not testing rules after saving</h3>
<p>Always verify your rule because caching depends on many conditions. A rule that matches too broadly may apply caching to pages that should not be cached.</p>

<h3>Mixing conflicting rules</h3>
<p>Rules are processed in order. A highly specific rule might be overridden by a broad rule if placed above it. Organize rules from most specific to least specific.</p>

<h3>Ignoring caching analytics</h3>
<p>Cloudflare analytics show how often requests are served from the edge. Low cache hit rates indicate your rules may not be effective and need revision.</p>

<h2 id="final-takeaways-for-beginners">Final takeaways for beginners</h2>
<p>Caching is one of the most impactful optimizations you can apply to a GitHub Pages site. By using Cloudflare cache rules, your site becomes faster, more reliable, and ready for global audiences. Static sites benefit naturally from caching because files rarely change, making long term caching strategies incredibly effective.</p>

<p>With clear patterns, proper TTL settings, and thoughtful invalidation routines, you can maintain a fast site without constant maintenance. This approach ensures visitors always experience smooth navigation, quick loading, and consistent performance. Cloudflare’s caching system gives you control that GitHub Pages alone cannot provide, turning your static site into a high-performance resource.</p>

<p>Once you understand these fundamentals, you can explore even more advanced optimization methods like cache revalidation, worker scripts, or edge-side transformations to refine your performance strategy further.</p>
