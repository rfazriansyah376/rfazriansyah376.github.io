---

<p>After securing your GitHub Pages from threats and malicious bots, the next step is to enhance its performance. A secure site that loads slowly will still lose visitors and search ranking. That’s where Cloudflare’s <strong>Page Rules</strong> and <strong>Rate Limiting</strong> come in — giving you control over caching, redirection, and request management to optimize speed and reliability. This guide explores how you can fine-tune your GitHub Pages for performance using Cloudflare’s intelligent edge tools.</p>

<h2 id="why-performance-matters">Why Performance Matters for GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>Performance directly affects how users perceive your site and how search engines rank it. GitHub Pages is fast by default, but as your content grows, static assets like images, scripts, and CSS files can slow things down. Even a one-second delay can impact user engagement and SEO ranking.</p>

<p>When integrated with Cloudflare, GitHub Pages benefits from global CDN delivery, caching at edge nodes, and smart routing. This setup ensures visitors always get the nearest, fastest version of your content — regardless of their location.</p>

<p>In addition to improving user experience, optimizing performance helps reduce bandwidth consumption and hosting overhead. For developers maintaining open-source projects or documentation, this efficiency can translate into a more sustainable workflow.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-page-rules">Understanding Cloudflare Page Rules</h2>
<p>Cloudflare Page Rules are one of the most powerful tools available for static websites like those hosted on GitHub Pages. They allow you to apply specific behaviors to selected URLs — such as custom caching levels, redirecting requests, or forcing HTTPS connections — without modifying your repository or code.</p>

<p>Each rule consists of three main parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>URL Pattern</strong> — defines which pages or directories the rule applies to (e.g., <code>yourdomain.com/blog/*</code>).</li>
  <li><strong>Settings</strong> — specifies the behavior (e.g., cache everything, redirect, disable performance features).</li>
  <li><strong>Priority</strong> — determines which rule is applied first if multiple match the same URL.</li>
</ul>

<p>For GitHub Pages, you can create up to three Page Rules in the free Cloudflare plan, which is often enough to control your most critical routes.</p>

<h2 id="using-page-rules-for-caching">Using Page Rules for Better Caching</h2>
<p>Caching is the key to improving speed. GitHub Pages serves your site statically, but Cloudflare allows you to cache resources aggressively across its edge network. This means returning pages from Cloudflare’s cache instead of fetching them from GitHub every time.</p>

<p>To implement caching optimization:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open your Cloudflare dashboard and navigate to <strong>Rules → Page Rules</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create Page Rule</strong>.</li>
  <li>Enter your URL pattern — for example:
    <pre><code>https://yourdomain.com/*</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Add the following settings:
    <ul>
      <li>Cache Level: <strong>Cache Everything</strong></li>
      <li>Edge Cache TTL: <strong>1 month</strong></li>
      <li>Browser Cache TTL: <strong>4 hours</strong></li>
      <li>Always Online: <strong>On</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Save and deploy the rule.</li>
</ol>

<p>This ensures Cloudflare serves your site directly from the cache whenever possible, drastically reducing load time for visitors and minimizing origin hits to GitHub’s servers.</p>

<h2 id="redirects-and-url-handling">Redirects and URL Handling Made Easy</h2>
<p>Cloudflare Page Rules can also handle redirects without writing code or modifying <code>_config.yml</code> in your GitHub repository. This is particularly useful when reorganizing pages, renaming directories, or enforcing HTTPS.</p>

<p>Common redirect cases include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Forcing HTTPS:
    <pre><code>https://yourdomain.com/* → Always Use HTTPS</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Redirecting old URLs:
    <pre><code>https://yourdomain.com/docs/* → https://yourdomain.com/guide/$1</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Custom 404 fallback:
    <pre><code>https://yourdomain.com/* → https://yourdomain.com/404.html</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This approach avoids unnecessary code changes and keeps your static site clean while ensuring visitors always land on the right page.</p>

<h2 id="using-rate-limiting">Using Rate Limiting to Protect Bandwidth</h2>
<p>Rate Limiting complements Page Rules by controlling how many requests an individual IP can make in a given period. For GitHub Pages, this is essential for preventing excessive bandwidth usage, scraping, or API abuse.</p>

<p>Example configuration:</p>
<pre><code>URL: yourdomain.com/*
Threshold: 100 requests per minute
Period: 10 minutes
Action: Block or JS Challenge</code></pre>

<p>When a visitor (or bot) exceeds this threshold, Cloudflare temporarily blocks or challenges the connection, ensuring fair usage. It’s an effective way to keep your GitHub Pages responsive under heavy traffic or automated hits.</p>

<h2 id="practical-configuration-example">Practical Configuration Example</h2>
<p>Let’s put everything together. Imagine you maintain a documentation site hosted on GitHub Pages with multiple pages, images, and guides. Here’s how an optimized setup might look:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Rule Type</th>
    <th>URL Pattern</th>
    <th>Settings</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cache Rule</td>
    <td>https://yourdomain.com/*</td>
    <td>Cache Everything, Edge Cache TTL 1 Month</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HTTPS Rule</td>
    <td>http://yourdomain.com/*</td>
    <td>Always Use HTTPS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Redirect Rule</td>
    <td>https://yourdomain.com/docs/*</td>
    <td>301 Redirect to /guide/*</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rate Limit</td>
    <td>https://yourdomain.com/*</td>
    <td>100 Requests per Minute → JS Challenge</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This configuration keeps your content fast, secure, and accessible with minimal manual management.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-and-tuning">Measuring and Tuning Your Site’s Performance</h2>
<p>After applying these rules, it’s crucial to measure improvements. You can use Cloudflare’s built-in Analytics or external tools like <strong>Google PageSpeed Insights</strong>, <strong>Lighthouse</strong>, or <strong>GTmetrix</strong> to monitor loading times and resource caching behavior.</p>

<p>Look for these indicators:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduced TTFB (Time to First Byte) and total load time.</li>
  <li>Lower bandwidth usage in Cloudflare analytics.</li>
  <li>Increased cache hit ratio (target above 80%).</li>
  <li>Stable performance under higher traffic volume.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve gathered data, adjust caching TTLs and rate limits based on observed user patterns. For instance, if your visitors mostly come from Asia, you might increase edge TTL for those regions or activate Argo Smart Routing for faster delivery.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices-for-sustainability">Best Practices for Sustainable Performance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Combine Cloudflare caching with lightweight site design — compress images, minify CSS, and remove unused scripts.</li>
  <li>Enable Brotli compression in Cloudflare for faster file transfer.</li>
  <li>Use custom cache keys if you manage multiple query parameters.</li>
  <li>Regularly review your firewall and rate limit settings to balance protection and accessibility.</li>
  <li>Test rule order: since Cloudflare applies them sequentially, place caching rules above redirects when possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sustainable optimization means making small, long-term adjustments rather than one-time fixes. Cloudflare gives you granular visibility into every edge request, allowing you to evolve your setup as your GitHub Pages project grows.</p>

<h2 id="final-takeaway">Final Takeaway</h2>
<p>Cloudflare Page Rules and Rate Limiting are not just for large-scale businesses — they’re perfect tools for static site owners who want reliable performance and control. When used effectively, they turn GitHub Pages into a high-performing, globally optimized platform capable of serving thousands of visitors with minimal latency.</p>

<p>If you’ve already implemented security and bot management from previous steps, this performance layer completes your foundation. The next logical move is integrating Cloudflare’s <strong>Edge Caching, Polish, and Early Hints</strong> features — the focus of our upcoming article in this series.</p>
