---

<p>Once your GitHub Pages site is secured and optimized with Page Rules, caching, and rate limiting, you can move toward a more advanced level of performance. Cloudflare offers edge technologies such as <strong>Edge Caching</strong>, <strong>Polish</strong>, and <strong>Early Hints</strong> that enhance load time, reduce bandwidth, and improve SEO metrics. These features work at the CDN level — meaning they accelerate content delivery even before the browser fully requests it.</p>

<h2 id="why-edge-optimization-matters">Why Edge Optimization Matters for Static Sites</h2>
<p>GitHub Pages is a globally distributed static hosting platform, but the actual performance your visitors experience depends on the distance to the origin and how well caching works. Edge optimization ensures that your content lives closer to your users — inside Cloudflare’s network of over 300 data centers worldwide.</p>

<p>By enabling edge caching and related features, you minimize <strong>TTFB (Time To First Byte)</strong> and improve <strong>LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)</strong>, both crucial factors in SEO ranking and Core Web Vitals. Faster sites not only perform better in search but also provide smoother navigation for returning visitors.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-edge-caching">Understanding Cloudflare Edge Caching</h2>
<p><strong>Edge Caching</strong> refers to storing versions of your website directly on Cloudflare’s edge nodes. When a user visits your site, Cloudflare serves the cached version immediately from a nearby data center, skipping GitHub’s origin server entirely.</p>

<p>This brings several benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduced latency — data travels shorter distances.</li>
  <li>Fewer origin requests — GitHub servers handle less traffic.</li>
  <li>Better reliability — your site stays available even if GitHub experiences downtime.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can enable edge caching by combining <strong>Cache Everything</strong> in Page Rules with an <strong>Edge Cache TTL</strong> value. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>Cache Level: Cache Everything  
Edge Cache TTL: 1 month  
Browser Cache TTL: 4 hours</code></pre>

<p>Advanced users on Cloudflare Pro or higher can use “Cache by Device Type” and “Custom Cache Keys” to differentiate cached content for mobile and desktop users. This flexibility makes static sites behave almost like dynamic, region-aware platforms without needing server logic.</p>

<h2 id="using-polish-to-optimize-images">Using Cloudflare Polish to Optimize Images</h2>
<p>Images often account for more than 50% of a website’s total load size. <strong>Cloudflare Polish</strong> automatically optimizes your images at the edge without altering your GitHub repository. It converts heavy files into smaller, more efficient formats while maintaining quality.</p>

<p>Here’s what Polish does:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removes unnecessary metadata (EXIF, color profiles).</li>
  <li>Compresses images losslessly or with minimal visual loss.</li>
  <li>Automatically serves WebP versions to browsers that support them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Configuration is straightforward:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to your Cloudflare Dashboard → <strong>Speed → Optimization → Polish</strong>.</li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Lossless</strong> or <strong>Lossy</strong> compression based on your preference.</li>
  <li>Enable <strong>WebP Conversion</strong> for supported browsers.</li>
</ol>

<p>After enabling Polish, Cloudflare automatically handles image optimization in the background. You don’t need to upload new images or change URLs — the same assets are delivered in lighter, faster versions directly from the edge cache.</p>

<h2 id="how-early-hints-reduces-loading-time">How Early Hints Reduce Loading Time</h2>
<p><strong>Early Hints</strong> is one of Cloudflare’s newer web performance innovations. It works by sending preload instructions to browsers before the main server response is ready. This allows the browser to start fetching CSS, JS, or fonts earlier — effectively parallelizing loading and cutting down wait times.</p>

<p>Here’s a simplified sequence:</p>
<ol>
  <li>User requests your GitHub Pages site.</li>
  <li>Cloudflare sends a 103 Early Hint with links to preload resources (e.g., <code>&lt;link rel="preload" href="/styles.css"&gt;</code>).</li>
  <li>Browser begins downloading assets immediately.</li>
  <li>When the full HTML arrives, most assets are already in cache.</li>
</ol>

<p>This feature can reduce perceived loading time by up to 30%. Combined with Cloudflare’s caching and Polish, it ensures that even first-time visitors experience near-instant rendering.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-results">Measuring Results and Performance Impact</h2>
<p>After enabling Edge Caching, Polish, and Early Hints, monitor performance improvements using <strong>Cloudflare Analytics → Performance</strong> and external tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest. Key metrics to track include:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Metric</th>
    <th>Before Optimization</th>
    <th>After Optimization</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TTFB</td>
    <td>550 ms</td>
    <td>190 ms</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LCP</td>
    <td>3.1 s</td>
    <td>1.8 s</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Page Weight</td>
    <td>1.9 MB</td>
    <td>980 KB</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cache Hit Ratio</td>
    <td>67%</td>
    <td>89%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These changes are measurable within days of activation. Moreover, SEO improvements follow naturally as Google detects faster response times and better mobile performance.</p>

<h2 id="real-world-example">Real-World Example of Optimized GitHub Pages Setup</h2>
<p>Consider a documentation site for a developer library hosted on GitHub Pages. Initially, it served images directly from the origin and didn’t use aggressive caching. After integrating Cloudflare’s edge features, here’s how the setup evolved:</p>

<pre><code>1. Page Rule: Cache Everything with Edge TTL = 1 Month  
2. Polish: Lossless Compression + WebP  
3. Early Hints: Enabled (via Cloudflare Labs)  
4. Brotli Compression: Enabled  
5. Auto Minify: CSS + JS + HTML  
6. Cache Analytics: Reviewed weekly  
7. Rocket Loader: Enabled for JS optimization</code></pre>

<p>The result was an 80% improvement in load time across North America, Europe, and Asia. Developers noticed smoother documentation access, and analytics showed a 25% decrease in bounce rate due to faster first paint times.</p>

<h2 id="sustainable-speed-practices">Sustainable Speed Practices for the Long Term</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Review caching headers monthly to align with your content update frequency.</li>
  <li>Combine Early Hints with efficient <code>&lt;link rel="preload"&gt;</code> tags in your HTML.</li>
  <li>Periodically test WebP delivery on different devices to ensure browser compatibility.</li>
  <li>Keep Cloudflare features like Auto Minify and Brotli active at all times.</li>
  <li>Leverage Cloudflare’s Tiered Caching to reduce redundant origin fetches.</li>
</ul>

<p>Performance optimization is not a one-time process. As your site grows or changes, periodic tuning keeps it running smoothly across evolving browser standards and device capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Cloudflare’s Edge Caching, Polish, and Early Hints represent a powerful trio for anyone hosting on GitHub Pages. They work quietly at the network layer, ensuring every asset — from HTML to images — reaches users as fast as possible. By adopting these edge optimizations, your site becomes globally resilient, energy-efficient, and SEO-friendly.</p>

<p>If you’ve already implemented security, bot filtering, and Page Rules from earlier articles, this step completes your performance foundation. In the next article, we’ll explore <strong>Cloudflare Workers and Transform Rules</strong> — tools that let you extend GitHub Pages functionality without touching your codebase.</p>
