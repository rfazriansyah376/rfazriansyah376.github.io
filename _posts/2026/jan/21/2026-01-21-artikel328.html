<summary id="pre-launch-week-0-setup"><h2>Pre-Launch Week 0: The Foundation Setup (Days 1-7)</h2></summary>
<p><b>Time Commitment:</b> 2-3 hours total. Do this before you create any public content.</p>

<h3>Day 1: Clarify Your Core (60-90 mins)</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Complete the <b>Personal Brand Blueprint</b> (Template from Article 7).
<br><b>Action Steps:</b>
<br>1. Open a new document.
<br>2. Answer: My <b>Why</b> (Mission), My <b>How</b> (3-5 Core Values), My <b>Who</b> (Ideal Audience Avatar).
<br>3. Define your 3 <b>Content Pillars</b> (topics you'll own).
<br>4. Describe your <b>Brand Voice</b> (3 adjectives).
<br><b>Done When:</b> You have a 1-page document summarizing your brand's heart.</p>

<h3>Day 2: Audit & Cleanup (30-45 mins)</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Audit your primary social profile.
<br><b>Action Steps:</b>
<br>1. Update your <b>bio</b> to reflect your new blueprint (clear who you help and how).
<br>2. Update your <b>profile picture</b> (professional, clear, friendly).
<br>3. Update your <b>link</b> (to a landing page, link-in-bio tool, or your best content).
<br>4. Archive or delete any glaringly off-brand old posts.
<br><b>Done When:</b> Your profile clearly communicates your new direction to a first-time visitor.</p>

<h3>Day 3: System Setup (45-60 mins)</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Set up your content and tracking systems.
<br><b>Action Steps:</b>
<br>1. Create a <b>Content Calendar</b> (Use Google Sheets/Notion. Columns: Date, Platform, Topic, Status).
<br>2. Create a <b>Weekly Metrics Tracker</b> (Columns: Date, Platform, Content, Comments, Saves, Shares).
<br>3. Bookmark the <b>Resource Hub (Article 7)</b> and <b>Series Index (Article 8)</b>.
<br><b>Done When:</b> You have two empty but structured spreadsheets/documents ready to use.</p>

<h3>Day 4: Tool Stack (30 mins)</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Choose and set up one core tool.
<br><b>Action Steps:</b>
<br>1. Sign up for <b>Canva</b> (free tier is fine). Create a simple "Brand Kit" with your 2 primary colors and a font.
<br>2. Decide on your primary content format (writing, video, audio). Choose one tool: <b>CapCut</b> for video, <b>Otter.ai</b> for transcription, <b>Grammarly</b> for writing.
<br><b>Done When:</b> You have Canva open with your colors saved, and one content tool installed.</p>

<h3>Day 5: First Content Plan (60 mins)</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Plan your first week of content using the Core-to-Branch framework.
<br><b>Action Steps:</b>
<br>1. Choose <b>one Core Topic</b> from your Pillar 1.
<br>2. Decide on your <b>Core Asset Format</b> (e.g., a LinkedIn article, a 5-minute video, a long Instagram carousel).
<br>3. Brainstorm <b>3 Branch Ideas</b> (e.g., a Twitter thread summary, a TikTok tip, an email snippet).
<br>4. Block time on your calendar to create these in the next 7 days.
<br><b>Done When:</b> Your content calendar has topics filled in for the next 7 days.</p>

<h3>Day 6: Mindset & Accountability (20 mins)</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Set your intentions and find accountability.
<br><b>Action Steps:</b>
<br>1. Write down your <b>#1 goal</b> for the next 30 days (e.g., "Publish 8 pieces of content," "Have 10 meaningful conversations," "Get 5 saves on a post").
<br>2. Tell <b>one person</b> about your 30-day commitment.
<br>3. Write down your <b>biggest fear</b> about putting yourself out there, then write a counter-mantra (e.g., Fear: "I'll look stupid." Mantra: "My genuine effort will help someone.").
<br><b>Done When:</b> You have a written goal, an accountability partner, and a mantra.</p>

<h3>Day 7: Rest & Reflect (0 mins work)</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Do nothing related to your brand.
<br><b>Action:</b> Seriously. Take the day off. Go for a walk. This builds the habit of sustainability from day one.
<br><b>Done When:</b> You feel recharged for the launch tomorrow.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary id="month-1-weeks-1-4-consistency"><h2>Month 1, Weeks 1-4: Consistency & First Content</h2></summary>
<p>Now, the public work begins. Focus on action, not perfection.</p>

<h3>Weekly Rhythm (Repeat for Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4)</h3>
<p><b>Monday (60-90 mins): Create Core Asset.</b>
<br>• Write that article, film that video, record that podcast.
<br>• Focus on delivering <b>one clear value</b>.</p>
<p><b>Tuesday (45 mins): Create Branch Content.</b>
<br>• Create 2-3 pieces adapted from your Core Asset (e.g., social posts, graphics, email).
<br>• Use your Canva templates.</p>
<p><b>Wednesday (30 mins): Schedule & Polish.</b>
<br>• Schedule your content for the week using platform native schedulers or a free tool like Later/Buffer.
<br>• Double-check links and captions.</p>
<p><b>Thursday (Daily, 15 mins): Engage.</b>
<br>• Respond to any comments on your posts.
<br>• Leave 2-3 thoughtful comments on other creators' posts in your niche.</p>
<p><b>Friday (20 mins): Review & Plan.</b>
<br>• Update your Metrics Tracker with this week's numbers.
<br>• Briefly note what topic got the best response.
<br>• Choose next week's Core Topic.</p>
<p><b>Saturday/Sunday: Rest.</b>
<br>• No brand work. This is non-negotiable.</p>

<h3>Weekly Focus Themes</h3>
<p><b>Week 1 Focus:</b> <b>Launch.</b> Your goal is simply to hit "publish" on your first Core Asset and 2-3 branch pieces. Celebrate doing it.</p>
<p><b>Week 2 Focus:</b> <b>Engagement.</b> Your goal is to spark one conversation. Ask a question in your caption. Reply to every comment with a question back.</p>
<p><b>Week 3 Focus:</b> <b>Value.</b> Review your Week 1 & 2 content. Which piece provided the most obvious utility? Create a "Part 2" or a deeper dive on that subtopic.</p>
<p><b>Week 4 Focus:</b> <b>Review.</b> Conduct your first <b>Monthly Review</b> (see Progress Tracking section below). Celebrate your consistency.</p>

<h3>Critical "Do Not" List for Month 1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>❌ Do NOT check your follower count more than once a week.</li>
  <li>❌ Do NOT compare your Day 5 to someone else's Year 5.</li>
  <li>❌ Do NOT change your strategy based on one post's low likes.</li>
  <li>❌ Do NOT skip your rest days.</li>
  <li>❌ Do NOT buy followers or use engagement pods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your only job in Month 1 is to build the habit of creating and engaging consistently. That's a massive win.</p>

<details>
<summary id="daily-weekly-habits"><h2>Essential Daily & Weekly Habits</h2></summary>
<p>These small, repeated actions build the muscle of an authentic brand.</p>

<h3>Daily Habits (5-15 minutes total)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>The Morning Input (5 mins):</b> Instead of scrolling social media first thing, read one article related to your niche or listen to a short podcast. This fuels your mind with quality input, not comparison.</li>
  <li><b>Authentic Engagement (5-10 mins):</b> Go to your notifications. Reply to comments. Then, visit the profile of one person who engaged and leave a genuine comment on their latest post. This builds real connection.</li>
  <li><b>Idea Capture (1 min):</b> When a content idea hits, immediately put it in your phone's notes app or a dedicated "Idea Bank" document. Don't trust your memory.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Weekly Habits (30-60 minutes)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Metrics Review (15 mins, Friday):</b> Update your tracker. Look at <b>Saves and Shares</b>, not just likes. What topic or format is winning?</li>
  <li><b>Content Planning (30 mins, Friday):</b> Plan next week's Core Topic and brainstorm 2 branch ideas. Put them in your calendar.</li>
  <li><b>One Community Action (15 mins, Any day):</b> Do one thing to foster community. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>Run a poll in your Stories asking what your audience struggles with.</li>
      <li>Share a user's post (with credit) that aligns with your values.</li>
      <li>Ask a "question of the week" in your post caption and feature the best answer in your next post.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Bi-Weekly Habit (20 mins)</h3>
<p><b>Consumption Audit:</b> Every two weeks, review who you're following. Unfollow accounts that make you feel inadequate, jealous, or distract from your niche. Follow 2-3 new people who inspire you with their authentic work.</p>

<h3>Monthly Habit (60 mins)</h3>
<p><b>The Monthly Review & Energy Check:</b> At the end of each month, answer these three questions in a journal:
<br>1. <b>What content felt most like "me" to create?</b>
<br>2. <b>What task drained my energy the most this month?</b> (Find one way to simplify it next month.)
<br>3. <b>What was my favorite interaction with someone in my audience?</b>
<br>This keeps you aligned, sustainable, and connected to the human element.</p>

<p>What gets measured gets managed. Use these simple tools.</p>

<h3>1. The 30-Day Tracker (Printable/Downloadable)</h3>
<pre><code>### 30-DAY AUTHENTICITY LAUNCH TRACKER
**Primary Goal for 30 Days:** [Write it here]

| Day | Core Asset Created? (Y/N) | Branch Content Published? (Y/N) | Meaningful Engagement? (Y/N) | Energy Level (1-5) | Win of the Day |
|-----|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1   |                           |                                  |                               |                     |                 |
| 2   |                           |                                  |                               |                     |                 |
| ... |                           |                                  |                               |                     |                 |
| 30  |                           |                                  |                               |                     |                 |

**Weekly Focus:**
- Week 1: Launch
- Week 2: Engagement
- Week 3: Value
- Week 4: Review

**Success Metrics (Track Weekly):**
- Week 1 Saves/Shares: ____
- Week 2 Saves/Shares: ____
- Week 3 Saves/Shares: ____
- Week 4 Saves/Shares: ____
</code></pre>

<h3>2. The "Don't Break the Chain" Calendar</h3>
<p>Print a blank calendar for the month. Each day you complete your core habit (e.g., "15 mins of engagement" or "publish scheduled content"), put a big "X" on that day. Your goal is not to break the chain of X's. This visual motivator is powerfully simple.</p>

<h3>3. Accountability Partnerships</h3>
<p><b>Find One Person:</b> This could be a fellow creator, a friend, or in an online community. Set up a <b>weekly 15-minute check-in</b> (via text, voice note, or call). Share:
<br>• One thing you shipped.
<br>• One lesson learned.
<br>• Your goal for next week.
<br>This external commitment dramatically increases follow-through.</p>

<h3>4. The "Win Jar"</h3>
<p>Get a physical jar or a digital note. Every time you have a small win—a nice comment, a save on your post, finishing a piece of content you're proud of—write it down and put it in the jar/note. On days you feel discouraged, read a few wins. This builds evidence of progress against self-doubt.</p>

<h3>Monthly Review Template</h3>
<pre><code>## MONTHLY REVIEW: [Month]
**1. Content Shipped:**
- Core Assets Created: [Number]
- Branch Pieces Published: [Number]

**2. Trust Metric Progress:**
- Total Saves: [Number] (↑ or ↓ from last month?)
- Total Shares: [Number]
- Best Performing Piece: [Title] - Why? [Note]

**3. Energy & Alignment:**
- High-Energy Task: [Task]
- Low-Energy Task: [Task] → Action: [Simplify/Delegate/Eliminate?]
- Alignment Score (1-10): [Score] - Why?

**4. Goal for Next Month (ONE only):**
- [e.g., Increase Save rate by 10%, Launch email newsletter, Try one new content format]

**Celebration:**
I am proud of myself for [One specific thing you did].

<br><b>Depth > Breadth</b>
<br><b>You > Comparison</b></p>

<h3>When You Feel Lost...</h3>
