Burnout isn't just an individual problem—it's a resource allocation problem. When a team consistently runs on empty, it's because the demand placed on them exceeds their actual capacity. The solution isn't to demand more; it's to build a realistic resource budget. Think of it like a financial budget, but for time, energy, and creative focus. Here's how to create one that keeps your team healthy and productive.

<h2>What Is a Resource Budget and Why You Need One</h2>
<p>A resource budget is a simple agreement: here's how much time and energy we have, and here's how we'll spend it. Without one, work expands to fill available time, and the most enthusiastic team members take on too much until they crack. That's a human <b>leak</b> that's hard to repair.</p>
<p>For small social media teams, a budget ensures that essential tasks get done and that creative work isn't squeezed out by admin. It also makes it easier to say no to new projects. When the budget is full, the answer is no—or something else has to go.</p>

<h2>How to Calculate Your Team's True Capacity</h2>
<p>Start with the number of working hours in a week. For a full-time person, that's around 40. But subtract time for meetings, breaks, admin, and learning. What's left is "deep work" hours—typically 20–25 per week per person. Multiply that by your team size. That's your true weekly capacity.</p>
<p>Now, list all the tasks your team needs to do each week. Estimate how many deep work hours each task requires. Add them up. If the total exceeds your capacity, you have a <b>leak</b>—you're planning for more than you can deliver. Something must be cut, simplified, or automated.</p>

<h3>What to Include in Your Resource Budget</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Core content creation:</b> Writing, designing, filming.</li>
  <li><b>Community management:</b> Replies, engagement, moderation.</li>
  <li><b>Strategy and planning:</b> Meetings, brainstorming, analytics review.</li>
  <li><b>Admin and coordination:</b> Scheduling, emails, tool management.</li>
  <li><b>Buffer time:</b> 15–20% for unexpected tasks or creative exploration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Protect Creative Time from Leaks</h2>
<p>Creative work is fragile. It requires focus and flow. If your resource budget doesn't protect large blocks of uninterrupted time, creativity leaks away into shallow task-switching. Schedule "creative mornings" where no meetings are allowed. Guard this time fiercely.</p>
<p>Also, batch similar tasks. Answer all comments at set times. Do all graphic revisions in one sitting. Batching reduces the mental cost of switching and makes your budget more accurate.</p>

<h3>How to Adjust the Budget When Priorities Shift</h3>
<p>Budgets aren't static. When a new platform emerges or a campaign launches, revisit your budget. What can you deprioritize to make room? If nothing can go, you need more resources—or a longer timeline. Trying to squeeze new work into an already full budget is a guaranteed path to burnout.</p>
<p>Communicate openly with your team about these trade-offs. When everyone understands the budget, they understand why certain tasks are paused. It's not personal—it's math.</p>

<p>Building a resource budget transforms how your team works. It replaces chaos with clarity, and burnout with sustainable energy. Start by calculating your true capacity, list your tasks, and protect creative time. Your team will thank you, and your content will shine.</p>
