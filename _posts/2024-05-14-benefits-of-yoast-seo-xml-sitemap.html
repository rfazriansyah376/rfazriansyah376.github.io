<h2>What is Yoast SEO XML Sitemap Functionality?</h2>
<p>The Yoast SEO XML Sitemap functionality generates a list of all the pages, posts, and other content on your website in a format that is easy for search engines to read. This sitemap helps search engines like Google understand the structure of your site and index it more effectively. By providing a roadmap of your website's content, the XML sitemap helps search engines crawl and index your site more efficiently, leading to better visibility in search results.</p>
