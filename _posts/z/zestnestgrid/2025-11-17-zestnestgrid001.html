<p>
Improving Cloudflare cache behavior for GitHub Pages is one of the simplest ways to boost site speed, stability, and user experience, especially because a static site relies heavily on optimized delivery. Banyak pemilik GitHub Pages belum memaksimalkan sistem cache sehingga banyak permintaan tetap dilayani langsung dari server origin GitHub. Artikel ini menjawab bagaimana Anda dapat mengatur, menyesuaikan, dan mengoptimalkan cache di Cloudflare agar setiap halaman dan aset dapat dimuat lebih cepat, konsisten, dan efisien.

<h2 id="why-cache-matters">Why Cache Optimization Matters for GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>
Many GitHub Pages users wonder why their site feels slower even though static files should load instantly. The truth is that GitHub Pages does not apply aggressive caching on its own. Without Cloudflare optimization, your visitors may repeatedly download the same assets instead of receiving cached versions. This increases latency and leads to inconsistent performance across different regions.
</p>
<p>
Optimized caching ensures your pages load from Cloudflare’s edge network, not from GitHub’s servers. This decreases Time to First Byte, reduces bandwidth usage, and creates a smoother browsing experience for both humans and crawlers. Search engines also appreciate fast, stable pages, which can indirectly improve SEO ranking.
</p>

<h2 id="default-behavior">Understanding Default Cache Behavior on GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>
GitHub Pages provides basic caching, but the default headers are conservative. HTML files generally have short cache durations. CSS, JS, and images may receive more reasonable caching, but still not enough to maximize speed. Cloudflare sits in front of this system and can override or enhance cache directives depending on your configuration.
</p>
<p>
For beginners, it’s important to understand that Cloudflare does not automatically cache HTML unless explicitly configured via rules. Without custom adjustments, your site delivers partial caching only, limiting the performance benefits of using a CDN.
</p>

<h2 id="core-strategies">Core Strategies to Improve Cloudflare Caching</h2>
<p>
There are several strategic adjustments you can apply to make Cloudflare handle caching more effectively. These changes work well for static sites like GitHub Pages because the content rarely changes and does not rely on server-side scripting.
</p>

<h3>Set Longer Browser Cache TTL</h3>
<p>
Longer browser TTL helps reduce repeated downloads by end users. For assets like CSS, JS, and images, longer values such as days or weeks are generally safe. GitHub Pages assets seldom change unless you redeploy, making long TTLs suitable.
</p>

<h3>Enable Cloudflare Edge Caching</h3>
<p>
Cloudflare’s edge caching stores files geographically closer to visitors, improving speed significantly. This is essential for global audiences accessing GitHub Pages from different continents. You can configure cache levels and override headers depending on how aggressively you want Cloudflare to store your content.
</p>

<h3>Use Cache Level: Cache Everything (With Consideration)</h3>
<p>
This option tells Cloudflare to treat all file types, including HTML, as cacheable. Because GitHub Pages is static, this approach can dramatically speed up page load times. However, it should be paired with proper bypass rules for sections that must stay dynamic, such as admin pages or search endpoints if you use client-side search.
</p>

<h2 id="html-caching">Should You Cache HTML Files at the Edge</h2>
<p>
This is a common question among GitHub Pages users. Caching HTML at the edge can reduce server round trips, but it also creates risk if you frequently update content. You need a smart balance to ensure both performance and freshness.
</p>

<h3>Benefits of HTML Caching</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Faster First Byte time</li>
  <li>Lower load on GitHub origin servers</li>
  <li>Consistent global delivery</li>
</ul>

<h3>Drawbacks and Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Updates may not appear immediately unless cache is purged</li>
  <li>Requires clean versioning strategies for assets</li>
</ul>

<p>
If your site updates rarely or only via manual commits, HTML caching is generally safe. For frequently updated blogs, consider shorter TTL values or rules that only cache assets while leaving HTML uncached.
</p>

<h2 id="cdn-settings">Recommended Cloudflare Settings for Beginners</h2>
<p>
Cloudflare offers many advanced controls, but beginners should start with simple, safe presets. The table below summarizes recommended configurations for GitHub Pages users who want reliable caching without overcomplicating the process.

<h2 id="practical-examples">Practical Real-World Examples</h2>
<p>
Imagine you manage a documentation website on GitHub Pages with hundreds of pages. Without Cloudflare optimization, your visitors may experience noticeable delays, especially those living far from GitHub’s servers. By applying Cache Everything and setting an appropriate Edge Cache TTL, pages begin loading almost instantly.
</p>
<p>
Another example is a simple portfolio website. These sites rarely change, making them perfect candidates for aggressive caching. Cloudflare can serve fully cached versions globally, ensuring a consistently fast experience with minimal maintenance.
</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
When used correctly, Cloudflare caching can transform the performance of your GitHub Pages site. The key is understanding how different cache layers work and applying rules that suit your site’s update frequency and audience needs. Static websites benefit greatly from proper caching, and even small adjustments can create significant improvements over time.
</p>

<p>
If Anda ingin melangkah lebih jauh, Anda bisa mengkombinasikan caching dengan fitur lain seperti URL normalization, Polish, atau Brotli compression untuk hasil performa yang lebih maksimal.
