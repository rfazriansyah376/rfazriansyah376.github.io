<p>
Adding a “Random Post” feature in Jekyll might sound simple, but it touches on one of the most fascinating parts of using static site generators: how to simulate dynamic behavior in a static environment. This approach makes your blog more engaging, keeps users exploring longer, and gives every post a fair chance to be seen. Let’s break down how to do it effectively using Liquid logic, without any plugins or JavaScript dependencies.
</p>

<h2>Why a Random Post Section Matters for Engagement</h2>

<p>
When visitors land on your blog, they often read one post and leave. But if you show a random or “discover more” section at the end, you can encourage them to keep exploring. This increases average session duration, reduces bounce rates, and helps older content remain visible over time.
</p>

<p>
The challenge is that Jekyll builds static files—meaning everything is generated ahead of time, not dynamically at runtime. So, how do you make something appear random when your site doesn’t use a live database? That’s where Liquid logic comes in.
</p>

<h2>How Liquid Can Simulate Randomness</h2>

<p>
Liquid itself doesn’t include a true random number generator, but it gives us tools to create pseudo-random behavior at build time. You can shuffle, offset, or rotate arrays to make your posts appear randomly across rebuilds. It’s not “real-time” randomization, but for static sites, it’s often good enough.
</p>

<h3>Simple Random Post Using Offset</h3>

<p>
Here’s a basic example of showing a single random post using <code>offset</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>
{% assign total_posts = site.posts | size %}
{% assign random_offset = total_posts | modulo: 5 %}
{% assign random_post = site.posts | offset: random_offset | first %}
&lt;div class="random-post"&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Random Pick:&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;a href="{{ random_post.url }}"&gt;{{ random_post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
In this example:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>site.posts | size</code> counts all available posts.</li>
  <li><code>modulo: 5</code> produces a pseudo-random index based on the build process.</li>
  <li>The post at that index is displayed each time you rebuild your site.</li>
</ul>

<p>
While not truly random for each page view, it refreshes with every new build—perfect for static sites hosted on GitHub Pages.
</p>

<h3>Showing Multiple Random Posts</h3>

<p>
You might prefer displaying several random posts rather than one. The key trick is to <strong>shuffle</strong> your posts and then limit how many are displayed.
</p>

<pre><code>
{% assign shuffled_posts = site.posts | sample:5 %}
&lt;div class="related-random"&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Discover More Posts&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  {% for post in shuffled_posts %}
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{{ post.url }}"&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  {% endfor %}
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
The <code>sample:5</code> filter is a Liquid addition supported by Jekyll that returns 5 random items from an array—in this case, your posts collection. It’s simple, clean, and efficient.
</p>

<h2>Building a Reusable Include for Random Posts</h2>

<p>
To keep your templates tidy, you can convert the random post block into an include file. Create a file called <code>_includes/random-posts.html</code> with the following content:
</p>

<pre><code>
{% assign random_posts = site.posts | sample:3 %}
&lt;section class="random-posts"&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;More to Explore&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  {% for post in random_posts %}
     &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;a href="{{ post.url }}"&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
  {% endfor %}
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
Then, include it at the end of your post layout like this:
</p>

<pre><code>{% include random-posts.html %}</code></pre>

<p>
Now, every post automatically includes a random selection of other articles—perfect for user retention and content discovery.
</p>

<h2>Using Data Files for Thematic Randomization</h2>

<p>
If you want more control, such as showing random posts only from the same category or tag, you can combine Liquid filters with data-driven logic. This ensures your “random” posts are also contextually relevant.
</p>

<h3>Example: Random Posts from the Same Category</h3>

<pre><code>
{% assign related = site.posts | where:"category", page.category | sample:3 %}
&lt;div class="random-category-posts"&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Explore More in {{ page.category }}&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  {% for post in related %}
     &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{{ post.url }}"&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  {% endfor %}
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
This keeps the user experience consistent—someone reading a Jekyll tutorial will see more tutorials, while a visitor reading about GitHub Pages will get more related articles. It feels smart and intentional, even though everything runs at build-time.
</p>

<h2>Improving User Interaction with Random Content</h2>

<p>
A random post feature is more than a novelty—it’s a strategy. Here’s how it helps:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Content Discovery:</strong> Readers can find older or hidden posts they might have missed.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced Bounce Rate:</strong> Visitors stay longer and explore deeper.</li>
  <li><strong>Equal Exposure:</strong> All your posts get a chance to appear, not just the latest.</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Feel:</strong> Even though your site is static, it feels fresh and active.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing Random Post Blocks Locally</h2>

<p>
Before pushing to GitHub Pages, test your random section locally using:
</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code></pre>

<p>
Each rebuild may show a new combination of random posts. If you’re using GitHub Actions or Netlify, these randomizations will refresh automatically with each new deployment or post addition.
</p>

<h2>Styling Random Post Sections for Better UX</h2>

<p>
Random posts are not just functional; they should also be visually appealing. Here’s a simple CSS example you can include in your stylesheet:
</p>

<pre><code>
.random-posts ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding-left: 0;
}
.random-posts li {
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}
.random-posts a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #0056b3;
}
.random-posts a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
You can adapt this style to fit your theme. Clean design ensures the section feels integrated rather than distracting.
</p>

<h2>Advanced Approach Using JSON Feeds</h2>

<p>
If you prefer real-time randomness without rebuilding the site, you can generate a JSON feed of posts and load one at random with JavaScript.  
However, this requires external scripts—something GitHub Pages doesn’t natively encourage.  
For fully static deployments, it’s usually better to rely on Liquid’s <code>sample</code> method for simplicity and reliability.
</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<p>
Even though adding random posts seems easy, there are some pitfalls to avoid:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t use <code>sample</code> excessively in large sites; it can slow down build times.</li>
  <li>Don’t show the same post as the one currently being read—use <code>where_exp</code> to exclude it.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>
{% assign others = site.posts | where_exp:"post","post.url != page.url" | sample:3 %}
</code></pre>

<p>
This ensures users always see genuinely different content.
</p>
