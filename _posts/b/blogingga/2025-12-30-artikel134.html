<h2 id="week-1-foundation-strategy">Week 1: Foundation & Strategy (Days 1-7)</h2>

<p>This week is about planning, not posting. Laying a strong strategic foundation prevents wasted effort later. Do not skip these steps.</p>

<h3>Day 1: Define Your Funnel Goal & Audience</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Answer in writing:
<ol>
<li><b>Primary Funnel Goal:</b> What is the single, measurable action you want people to take at the end? (e.g., "Book a discovery call," "Purchase Product X," "Subscribe to premium plan").</li>
<li><b>Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):</b> Who is your perfect customer? Define demographics, job title (if B2B), core challenges, goals, and where they hang out online.</li>
<li><b>Current State Audit (If Existing):</b> List your current social platforms, follower counts, and last month's best-performing post.</li>
</ol>
<b>Output:</b> A one-page document with your goal and ICP description.</p>

<h3>Day 2: Choose Your Primary Platform(s)</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Based on your ICP and goal, select 1-2 primary platforms for your funnel.
<ul>
<li><b>B2B/High-Ticket:</b> LinkedIn, Twitter (X).</li>
<li><b>Visual Product/DTC:</b> Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok.</li>
<li><b>Local Service:</b> Facebook, Nextdoor.</li>
<li><b>Knowledge/Coaching:</b> LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<b>Rule:</b> You must be able to describe <i>why</i> each platform is chosen. "Because it's popular" is not a reason.
<b>Output:</b> A shortlist of 1-2 core platforms.</p>

<h3>Day 3: Craft Your Lead Magnet</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Brainstorm and decide on your lead magnet. It must be:
<ul>
<li>Hyper-specific to one ICP pain point.</li>
<li>Deliver immediate, actionable value.</li>
<li>Act as a "proof of concept" for your paid offer.</li>
</ul>
<b>Examples:</b> Checklist, Template, Mini-Course (5 emails), Webinar Replay, Quiz with personalized results.
<b>Output:</b> A clear title and one-paragraph description of your lead magnet.</p>

<h3>Day 4: Map the Customer Journey</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Sketch the funnel stages for your platform(s).
<ol>
<li><b>TOFU (Awareness):</b> What type of content will attract cold audiences? (e.g., Educational Reels, problem-solving threads).</li>
<li><b>MOFU (Consideration):</b> How will you promote the lead magnet? (e.g., Carousel post, Story with link, dedicated video).</li>
<li><b>BOFU (Conversion):</b> What is the direct offer and CTA? (e.g., "Book a call," "Buy now," with a retargeting ad).</li>
</ol>
<b>Output:</b> A simple diagram or bullet list for each stage.</p>

<h3>Day 5: Set Up Tracking & Metrics</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Decide how you will measure success.
<ul>
<li>TOFU KPI: <i>Reach, Engagement Rate, Profile Visits.</i></li>
<li>MOFU KPI: <i>Click-Through Rate (CTR), Lead Conversion Rate.</i></li>
<li>BOFU KPI: <i>Sales Conversion Rate, Cost Per Acquisition (CPA).</i></li>
</ul>
Ensure Google Analytics 4 is installed on your website. Create a simple Google Sheet to log these metrics weekly.
<b>Output:</b> A measurement spreadsheet with your KPIs defined.</p>

<h3>Day 6: Audit/Set Up Social Profiles</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> For each chosen platform, ensure your profile is optimized:
<ul>
<li>Professional/brand-consistent profile photo and cover image.</li>
<li>Bio clearly states who you help, how, and has a CTA to your link (lead magnet landing page).</li>
<li>Contact information and website link are correct.</li>
</ul>
<b>Output:</b> Optimized social profiles.</p>

<h3>Day 7: Plan Your Week 2 Content Batch</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Using your journey map, plan the specific content you'll create in Week 2.

<li>MOFU: 1-2 ideas directly promoting your lead magnet.</li>
<li>BOFU: 1 idea (e.g., a testimonial graphic, a product demo teaser).</li>
</ul>
<b>Output:</b> A content ideas list for the next week.</p>

<h2 id="week-2-content-asset-creation">Week 2: Content & Asset Creation (Days 8-14)</h2>

</ul>
<b>Output:</b> The finished lead magnet file.</p>

<h3>Day 9: Build Your Landing Page</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Create a simple, focused landing page for your lead magnet.
<ul>

<h2 id="day-30-analyze-optimize">Day 30: Analyze, Optimize & Plan Ahead</h2>

<p>This is your monthly review day. Stop creating, and start learning from the data.</p>

<h3>Comprehensive Monthly Review</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Gather all your data from the last 29 days. Fill out your metrics spreadsheet with final numbers.</p>

<p><b>Questions to Answer:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>TOFU:</b> Which post had the highest reach and engagement? What was the hook/topic/format?</li>
<li><b>MOFU:</b> How many leads did you generate? What was your landing page conversion rate? What was the cost per lead (if any)?</li>
<li><b>BOFU/Nurture:</b> How many sales/conversions came from this funnel? What is your lead-to-customer rate? What was your email open/click rate?</li>
<li><b>Overall:</b> What was your estimated Return on Investment (ROI) or Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)?</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Identify Your #1 Optimization Priority</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Based on your review, identify the single biggest leak or opportunity in your funnel.
<ul>
<li><b>Low TOFU Reach?</b> Priority: Improve content hooks and experiment with new formats (e.g., video).</li>
<li><b>Low MOFU Conversion?</b> Priority: A/B test your landing page headline or lead magnet.</li>
<li><b>Low BOFU Conversion?</b> Priority: Strengthen your email nurture sequence or offer clarity.</li>
</ul>
<b>Output:</b> One clear optimization priority for Month 2.</p>

<h3>Create Your Month 2 Action Plan</h3>
<p><b>Task:</b> Using your priority, plan your focus for the next 30 days.
<ul>
<li>If optimizing MOFU: "Month 2 Goal: Increase lead conversion rate from 10% to 15% by testing two new landing page headlines."</li>
<li>Schedule your next monthly review for Day 60.</li>
</ul>
<b>Output:</b> A simple 3-bullet-point plan for Month 2.</p>

<p>Congratulations. You have moved from theory to practice. You have a live, measurable social media funnel. The work now shifts from building to refining, from launching to scaling. By repeating this cycle of creation, promotion, analysis, and optimization, you turn your funnel into a reliable, ever-improving engine for business growth.</p>

<h3 id="checklist-tips-execution">Pro Tips for Checklist Execution</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Time Block:</b> Dedicate 60-90 minutes each day to these tasks. Consistency beats marathon sessions.</li>
<li><b>Accountability:</b> Share your plan with a friend, colleague, or in an online community. Commit to posting your Day 30 results.</li>
<li><b>Perfection is the Enemy:</b> Your first funnel will not be perfect. The goal is "launched and learning," not "flawless." It's better to have a functioning funnel at 80% than a perfect plan that's 0% launched.</li>
<li><b>Leverage Tools:</b> Use project management tools like Trello, Asana, or a simple Notion page to track your checklist progress.</li>
<li><b>Celebrate Milestones:</b> Finished your lead magnet? That's a win. Got your first subscriber? Celebrate it. Small wins build momentum.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="troubleshooting-common-blocks">Troubleshooting Common Blocks</h3>
<p><b>Block:</b> "I can't think of a good lead magnet."
<br><b>Solution:</b> Go back to your ICP's #1 pain point. What is a simple, step-by-step solution you can give away? A checklist is almost always a winner. Start there.
</p>
<p><b>Block:</b> "I'm stuck on Day 11 (creating content)."
<br><b>Solution:</b> Lower the bar. Your first video can be a 30-second talking head on your phone. Your first graphic can be a simple text-on-image in Canva. Done is better than perfect.
</p>
<p><b>Block:</b> "I launched but got zero leads in Week 3."
<br><b>Solution:</b> Diagnose. Did your MOFU post get clicks? If no, the hook/offer is weak. If yes, but no sign-ups, the landing page is the problem. Test one change at a time.
</p>
<p><b>Block:</b> "This feels overwhelming."
<br><b>Solution:</b> Focus only on the task for today. Do not think about Day 29 when you're on Day 8. The checklist works because it's sequential. Trust the process.
</p>

<p>This 30-day checklist is your map from confusion to clarity, from inaction to results. The most successful marketers aren't geniuses; they are executors who follow a system. That system is now in your hands. Your funnel awaits.</p>

<p><b>Stop planning. Start doing.</b> Your first action is not to read more. It's to <b>open your calendar right now</b> and block 60 minutes tomorrow for "Day 1: Define Funnel Goal & Audience." The clock starts now.</p>
