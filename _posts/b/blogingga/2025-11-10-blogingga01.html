<p>Managing bot traffic on a static site hosted with GitHub Pages can be tricky because you have limited server-side control. However, with Cloudflare’s Firewall Rules and Bot Management, you can shield your site from automated threats, scrapers, and suspicious traffic without needing to modify your repository. This article explains how to protect your GitHub Pages from bad bots using Cloudflare’s intelligent filters and adaptive security rules.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-bot-traffic">Understanding Bot Traffic on GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>GitHub Pages serves content directly from a CDN, making it easy to host but challenging to filter unwanted traffic. While legitimate bots like Googlebot or Bingbot are essential for indexing your content, many bad bots are designed to scrape data, overload bandwidth, or look for vulnerabilities. Cloudflare acts as a protective layer that distinguishes between helpful and harmful automated requests.</p>

<p>Malicious bots can cause subtle problems such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increased bandwidth costs and slower site loading speed.</li>
  <li>Artificial traffic spikes that distort analytics.</li>
  <li>Scraping of your HTML, metadata, or SEO content for spam sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>By deploying Cloudflare Firewall Rules, you can automatically detect and block such requests before they reach your GitHub Pages origin.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-firewall-rules">Setting Up Cloudflare Firewall Rules</h2>
<p>Cloudflare Firewall Rules allow you to create precise filters that define which requests should be allowed, challenged, or blocked. The interface is intuitive and does not require coding skills.</p>

<p>To configure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and select your domain connected to GitHub Pages.</li>
  <li>Open the <strong>Security &gt; WAF</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>Under the <strong>Firewall Rules</strong> section, click <strong>Create a Firewall Rule</strong>.</li>
  <li>Set an expression like:
    <pre><code>(cf.client.bot) eq false and http.user_agent contains "curl"</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Action → Block</strong> or <strong>Challenge (JS)</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This simple logic blocks requests from non-verified bots or tools that mimic automated scrapers. You can refine your rule to exclude Cloudflare-verified good bots such as Google or Facebook crawlers.</p>

<h2 id="using-bot-management">Using Cloudflare Bot Management Features</h2>
<p>Cloudflare Bot Management provides an additional layer of intelligence, using machine learning to differentiate between legitimate automation and malicious behavior. While this feature is part of Cloudflare’s paid plans, its “Bot Fight Mode” (available even on the free plan) is a great start.</p>

<p>When activated, Bot Fight Mode automatically applies rate limits and blocks to bots attempting to scrape or overload your site. It also adds a lightweight challenge system to confirm that the visitor is a human. For GitHub Pages users, this means a significant reduction in background traffic that doesn't contribute to your SEO or engagement metrics.</p>

<h2 id="analyzing-traffic-patterns">Analyzing Suspicious Traffic Patterns</h2>
<p>Once your firewall and bot management are active, you can monitor their effectiveness from Cloudflare’s <strong>Analytics → Security</strong> dashboard. Here, you can identify IPs, ASNs, or user agents responsible for frequent challenges or blocks.</p>

<p>Example insight you might find:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>IP Range</th>
    <th>Country</th>
    <th>Action Taken</th>
    <th>Count</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>103.225.88.0/24</td>
    <td>Russia</td>
    <td>Blocked (Firewall)</td>
    <td>1,234</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>45.95.168.0/22</td>
    <td>India</td>
    <td>JS Challenge</td>
    <td>540</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Reviewing this data regularly helps you fine-tune your rules to minimize false positives and ensure genuine users are never blocked.</p>

<h2 id="combining-rate-limiting">Combining Rate Limiting and Custom Rules</h2>
<p>Rate Limiting adds an extra security layer by limiting how many requests can be made from a single IP within a set time frame. This prevents brute force or scraping attempts that bypass basic filters.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>URL: /*  
Threshold: 100 requests per minute  
Action: Challenge (JS)  
Period: 10 minutes</code></pre>

<p>This configuration helps maintain site performance and ensure fair use without compromising access for normal visitors. It’s especially effective for GitHub Pages sites that include searchable documentation or public datasets.</p>

<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices for Long-Term Protection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep your Cloudflare security logs under review at least once a week.</li>
  <li>Whitelist known search engine bots (Googlebot, Bingbot, etc.) using Cloudflare’s “Verified Bots” filter.</li>
  <li>Apply region-based blocking for countries with high attack frequencies if your audience is location-specific.</li>
  <li>Combine firewall logic with Cloudflare Rulesets for scalable policies.</li>
  <li>Monitor bot analytics to detect anomalies early.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, security is an evolving process. Cloudflare continuously updates its bot intelligence models, so revisiting your configuration every few months helps ensure your protection stays relevant.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary of Key Insights</h2>
<p>Cloudflare’s Firewall Rules and Bot Management are crucial for protecting your GitHub Pages site from harmful automation. Even though GitHub Pages doesn’t offer backend control, Cloudflare bridges that gap with real-time traffic inspection and adaptive blocking. By combining custom rules, rate limiting, and analytics, you can maintain a fast, secure, and SEO-friendly static site that performs well under any condition.</p>

<p>If you’ve already secured your GitHub Pages using Cloudflare custom rules, this next level of bot control ensures your site stays stable and trustworthy for visitors and search engines alike.</p>
